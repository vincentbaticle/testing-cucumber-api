Feature: Test Good text for mailto 
  As a QA
  I want to make sure the mailto href and text are matching 
  
  Scenario: Check mailto href and text are matching
   Given I am on page "<end_url>"
   When I choose the mailto "<mailto>"
   Then the mailto name text  should be same as mailto
   
   Examples:
    | end_url    | mailto  | 
    | contact-fr | communication@believedigital.com |
