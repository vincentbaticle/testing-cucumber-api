Feature: Test Time page access 
  As a QA
  I want to make sure the Time page access is good 
  
  Scenario: Check the Time page access is good 
   Given I click on page "<end_url>"
   When I load the page
   Then the time should be less "<time>" 
   
   Examples:
    | end_url    | time | 
    | contact-fr | 560  |  
	| contact    | 560  |
	| values     | 560  |
	| teams      | 700  |
